# Material UI Web3

Material UI Web3 is relatively barebones boilerplate for Ethereum DApps. This project makes use of primarily Ethers.js and useDapp to interface with the Ethereum blockchain, using Material UI (MUI) V5 for the user interface.

## Getting started

First off, it's important to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Infura API key to this file, this will enable your DApp to work in read-only mode (i.e. before a user connects their wallet provider).

Before using this in a live deployment, make sure to replace the favicon and logos located in the `public` folder.

## Scripts

### `yarn`

Installs required packages

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
